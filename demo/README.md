#### Installation
The package.json has all the details about the application. The following command will install all the dependencies.

	npm install
		
Please contact selvam1991@gmail.com if there is difficulty while the setup.

#### Build using GruntJs

	grunt build



#### NodeJs
Please update your node installation. v0.10.12 is used while development.
